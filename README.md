The initial layout and theme of the website is complete (a section to utilise the Instagram and LinkedIn APIs may be added later)

The fading image on page open has been removed for now, to be replaced with a html5 animation

Content will be added to the languages and cards components: languages will have bars representing competency in different coding languages and cards will have flip cards that are randomised by a button and which contain fun facts about me

Page will be made dynamic for all screen sizes and mobile

Header: 'Lydia Welham' will become transparent / smaller! Links will stay visible over white backgrounds
